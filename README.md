Project Euler Mathematical Coding Challenges Written in C++ 17 and forward!

I will be periodically answering Project Euler mathematical challenges using C++ Datastructures, OOP, functional programming. 

From Line 86 down.

These solutions will be unique to me, don't expect optimal but they should work. 

I will also be practicing fundamental C++ concepts, important to stay fresh.

Make sure you select the right radio buttons below before building. 

TBD - I will make these h/cpp files and optimize them later over time. 

The point of this is to continually practice / solve computational challenges.
