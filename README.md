Includes C++ and Python -Will be in seperate files, doing this because I had some downtime. 

Hackerrank practiced problems
Datastructures practice. (I will pseudo code my thought process and code them up!) 

Project Euler Mathematical Coding Challenges Written in C++ 17 and forward!

I will be periodically answering Project Euler mathematical challenges using C++ Datastructures, OOP, functional programming. 

These solutions will be unique to me, don't expect optimal but they should work. 

I will also be practicing fundamental concepts, important to stay fresh.

To Run this, copy and paste the C++ text file into:

copy and paste the python text file into:

Make sure you select the right radio buttons below before building. 
TBD - I will make these h/cpp files and optimize them later over time. 
TBD - I will also stick the python txt files into .py files as well. 

The point of this is to continually practice / solve computational challenges. 

Some of these functions may be used in future projects....data science / ML emphasis. (Probably script the python to call C++ code to extract data. Will need some more thought.)
