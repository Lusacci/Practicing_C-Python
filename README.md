Project Euler Mathematical Coding Challenges Written in C++ 11 and forward!

I will be periodically answering Project Euler mathematical challenges using C++ Datastructures, OOP, functional programming. 

These solutions will be unique to me, don't expect optimal but they should work.

TBD - I will make these h/cpp files and optimize them later over time. 

The point of this is to continually practice / solve computational challenges.
